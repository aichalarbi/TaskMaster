This React application is a task management tool leveraging Redux for state management. It utilizes React Bootstrap for responsive and visually appealing UI components. The app consists of two main components: AddTask for adding new tasks and ListTask for displaying a list of tasks. The Redux store is provided to the components via the Provider component from react-redux, enabling seamless state management across the application. The project is structured to ensure scalability and maintainability, with Redux DevTools extension integrated for easier debugging and development.
